This is a Next.js project that aims to list and visualize coyote incidents in the city of Toronto, particularly in the Fort York and City Place neighborhoods.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Set up dependencies
yarn

# Run development server
yarn dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

To show test data, change the `fetchIncidents` function in `src/app/store/fetchData.ts` to `fetchTestIncidents`.
